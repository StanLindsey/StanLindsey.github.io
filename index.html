</a>
<h1>Its Free!</h1>
<p>The call is completely free (free like air) and there are no obligations. We'll briefly discuss your business, your goals and issues to point you in the right direction.</p>
<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
<p>After the initial phone call we'll have a better idea of how to move forward. The next step is usually a Rapid-Discovery or Roadmapping session.</p>
<h2>What is a Rapid-Discovery Session?</h2>
<p>A Rapid-Discovery Session is an up to an hour long focused conversation where we run through all the opportunities and issues your business is facing. We make sure we're a good fit for future projects and you'll receive valuable insights into how your business can grow.
  <br/>
  <a href="mailto:contact@stanlindsey.net?subject=Rapid-Discovery Session&body=Hi Stan, I wanted to know more about your Rapid-Discovery Session. Could you give me all the details?">Find Out More About Rapid-Discovery</a>
</p>
<h2>What is a Roadmapping Session?</h2>
<p>A Roadmapping session is a small-scale, low-risk project where we focus on your needs and work together to discover how to solve them in detail. This allows us to work together before committing to a larger project and gives you a roadmap of all the details to get your project started.

<h2>And Then What?</h2>
<p>Its completely up to you. At this stage you will have some projects laid out and valuable insights into your business that you can take anywhere to get started with.</p>
<h2>I'm not sure I even need help</h2>
<p>Every business could be improved somehow, talking to an expert will at least keep you informed and up to date.</p>
<h2>I've been burnt before</h2>
<p>If you've been burnt before by developers that don't understand your business and don't get you results (or even completely disappear!) then have no fear. I aim to be a partner to your business as it grows; only taking on projects that solve real business problems and make a return on  investment.</p>
<h2>I have more questions</h2>
<p>No worries, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:contact@stanlindsey.net">contact@stanlindsey.net</a> and I'll respond within one business day.</p>

<h1>100% Money Back Guarantee</h1>
<p>You heard that right! I'm so sure I can give you at least one good piece of advice that if you aren't happy after the Rapid-Discovery or Roadmapping session I'll give you your money back! How's that for service.</p>
